The emulater can be installed through Android Studio (Please go through the respective documentation for more details.)\n\nHow to install in your develop environment?\n1. Clone the source code from https://github.com/chinnapandian/OxsEye to your local environment. Then change the directory to OxsEye and run npm install to install the needed dependencies to make it run the application.\n2. Once successfully installed, run this command tns build android --clean and then tns debug android\n3. Once the above steps done successfully, you can see the app running in device or emulator you installed.\n\nGUI\nPlease click here at GUI Flow for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started -
